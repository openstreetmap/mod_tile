meta2tile is a small utility to convert meta tiles into normal tiles
or MBTiles.

When converting to normal tiles, it is similar to convert_meta.c, but 
convert_meta.c creates individual tiles in a "hashed" directory structure 
whereas meta2tile creates them in a simple z/x/y directory structure.

When converting to MBTiles, meta2tile essentially does what you would get
when you first created normal tiles and then packed them using mbutil. 
If you need MBTiles, then the direct way from metatiles to MBTiles will
save a lot of time over going via individual tiles.

meta2tile also has the capability of sorting your tiles by area, e.g. if
you have a directory with a world-wide set of tiles but only want to
extract Europe and Australia or so. For this, create a shape file that 
contains the areas you want to run the export for, each with a column 
named "target" that has the output file name or path for that area.
